### What is Virtual Cinema?
When was the last time you visited a movie theatre? <br>
  - Virtual cinema brings the cinema experience to your room with all the intimate interactions at the movies 
   between you and your loved ones. 
  - This web app allows hosting a virtual watch party, similar to the popular Netflix Party chrome extension, but with more features for a cherishable experience.
  - Here friends can watch together the videos from websites which allow video embedding – YouTube, Vimeo, Streamable, and even from Facebook!

### Outline
  - A user sets up a link to a video and invites family, friends, or their loved ones to join. 
    - The host can invite users via SMS or email and set a particular time to start the video (similar to scheduled zoom meetings). 
    - By default, the video continues to play from when the users joined – just like what happens when you hop onto a YouTube live.
  - When the watch party is started – the friends can type into the chat box their reactions – just like the live chat in YouTube live video.
  - Users will be able to control the playback and speed of the video, which will be automatically synced.
  - Users also can chat over voice, similar to the discord VoIP feature, to simulate the experience of laughing or being terrified at particular scenes.
  - Users can choose to join with real time video for purposes of recording a reaction video with participants. 
    - After the video finishes, users will also have an option to export a recording of the entire session to share as a reaction video.
  - Just like a subtitle file (e.g. .srt file extension), which we often see for movies, which store text for a video accompanied by its timestamps; 
    - we similarly store all the reactions (can be text/gifs/photos) of all the friends in a room in a file. 
    - The file will be saved in the theatre room’s log, to be replayed at a later point of time for friends to relinquish their memories!
